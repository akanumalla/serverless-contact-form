# H1 Lambda-Contact

A simple lambda function created to allow contact form posts from our static website hosted on S3/Cloudfront.

I made this in August 2015 for a startup I joined and haven't really looked at it since. So I'm sure there are some improvements to be made.

# H2 TODO

1. Create deployment script. (easy wth aws-cli)
2. Instructions. :D 
3. Look into using policies instead of using tokens.
